Louisiana was adversely affected by Hurricane Gustav.
I've added information to the left hand side of my blog where you can assist the hurricane relief.
Here's what happened to me and my family:
We watched the storm moving in all of last weekend on the Weather Channel and local news.
I went to Home Depot just in the nick of time to purchase a portable generator.
I filled up my three SUVs and I filled up five five-gallon containers of gasoline.
We purchased supplies to last us a few days.
Since I live about 60 miles from the coast, I wasn't expecting too much damage.
The storm rolled in on Monday, September 1, in the morning.
Power went out about 11:00am.
Winds started kicking up.
We were told our area would get winds of about 50mph.
I live in an area where there are lots of large pine and oak trees.
About 12:30pm, I was standing on my back patio when I watched a large tree split in two and fall in my neighbor's yard.
I started to get nervous at that point because I have numerous trees near my home and I was concerned that if those fell, it would cause serious damage to my home and perhaps to my family.
My wife, our five children, and our dog, stayed in an area of the home where we felt safest.
Then, I heard a large crash.
I looked out my front window and saw that a tree from my across-the-street neighbor's house had fallen on top of another neighbor's RV.
Trees were dropping all around us.
Another tree fell on my riding lawn mower and my golf cart.
Fortunately, no trees fell on my house.
Many of my neighbors were not so fortunate.
President Bush came to Baton Rouge yesterday to assess the damage.
I have three good friends on Governor Jindal's cabinet and I know that they are doing a super job bringing things back to order.
It's been three days since the storm and I still do not have electricity - but that is expected given all the downed power lines.
Unfortunately, my brand new generator does not work - I brought it in for repair.
Thankfully, my parents' house had electricity restored the day after the storm so I was able to bring my family to their house until electricity at my house gets restored.
There are downed trees and power lines all over the city.

A Crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a Fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese.
Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, "What a noble bird I see above me!
Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite.
If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the Birds."
The Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw.
Down came the cheese, of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, "You have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits."

A Fox invited a Stork to dinner, at which the only fare provided was a large flat dish of soup.
The Fox lapped it up with great relish, but the Stork with her long bill tried in vain to partake of the savoury broth.
Her evident distress caused the sly Fox much amusement.
But not long after the Stork invited him in turn, and set before him a pitcher with a long and narrow neck, into which she could get her bill with ease.
Thus, while she enjoyed her dinner, the Fox sat by hungry and helpless, for it was impossible for him to reach the tempting contents of the vessel.

A few years ago, a young man died out on my front lawn when he crashed his motorbike.
I was with him in his last moments but there was
nothing I could do because he was badly injured with a broken neck.
Later, when I was visiting the place where he died, I decided to talk to him as if he were still there because I wanted him to know how bad I felt that I couldnt help him.
And I know this sounds crazy, but I saw this ball of light in the trees above me.
At first, my logical mind thought that it was my brother playing around with his new flashlight (not at all like it, but the closest thing I could imagine)
And when I went inside the house, everyone was snoring!
Lol could this have been what they call an orb

Not the first weird experience ive had.

But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; and then there ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two.

Kelly woke up one morning and went outside to her back yard.
She was in a hurry because it was Mother's Day and she had to collect flowers before her mom woke up to give to her as a present.
She was going to give her mom the biggest, most beautiful bunch of flowers her mother had ever seen.
She knew where the best flowers were in her yard.
She got a lot of different sized flowers.
The red ones were big, the orange ones were small, and the green ones were in the middle.
After Kelly collected all of the flowers, she went inside and tied them together with string.
After that, she had to hide the flowers in a secret spot.
She hoped her baby sister Morgan, who was still in diapers, wouldn't find the flowers and eat them.
Kelly was worried, so she hid them in a new spot that was up higher.
Finally, her mother woke up at 8:30 AM, and Kelly was excited!
Kelly gave her mother the flowers.
Her mother's favorite was the red one.
