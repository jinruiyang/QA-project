Kelly woke up one morning and went outside to her back yard.
She was in a hurry because it was Mother's Day and she had to collect flowers before her mom woke up to give to her as a present.
She was going to give her mom the biggest, most beautiful bunch of flowers her mother had ever seen.
She knew where the best flowers were in her yard.
She got a lot of different sized flowers.
The red ones were big, the orange ones were small, and the green ones were in the middle.
After Kelly collected all of the flowers, she went inside and tied them together with string.
After that, she had to hide the flowers in a secret spot.
She hoped her baby sister Morgan, who was still in diapers, wouldn't find the flowers and eat them.
Kelly was worried, so she hid them in a new spot that was up higher.
Finally, her mother woke up at 8:30 AM, and Kelly was excited!
Kelly gave her mother the flowers.
Her mother's favorite was the red one.
